# New Canvas Quiz to Respondus 4.0 Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet tool extracts quiz data from a Canvas LMS (Learning Management System) New Quiz page and converts it into a Respondus 4.0-formatted plain text file that can be imported into a Respondus 4.0 assessment tool.

## How it works

When you click the bookmarklet on a Canvas New Quiz page, it automatically fetches the quiz information for that specific quiz. Then, it transforms the quiz data into a format compatible with Respondus 4.0.

Once the data is in the Respondus 4.0 format, the bookmarklet downloads a plain text file to your computer.

In short, this tool streamlines the process of transferring quiz data from a Canvas New Quiz page to a Respondus 4.0-compatible file, making it easier and more efficient for instructors who use both Canvas and Respondus 4.0 to manage their course assessments.

## Limitations

Please note that the script is still in early development and has some limitations:

- It currently only supports exporting basic quiz types (multiple choice, essay, true/false, and matching).
- It cannot yet handle quizzes that pull from an item bank.
- The script is designed to work with quizzes containing 100 or fewer questions.
